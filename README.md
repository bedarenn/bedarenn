## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Profile

Welcome to my GitHub profile repository! This is where I showcase my projects and skills as a developer, specializing in C, C++, Docker, Makefile, and team collaboration.

## Skills
- **C & C++**: Developed efficient, high-performance applications.
- **Docker**: Mastery of containerization for consistent and scalable application deployment.
- **Makefile**: Expertise in automating build processes.
- **Team Collaboration**: Strong experience in working with development teams using version control and agile methodologies.

## Projects
Here are some of my notable projects:
- **[ft_irc](https://github.com/bedarenn/IRC)**: The ft_irc project is a C++ implementation of an IRC server that handles multiple connections via sockets. It supports essential IRC commands like /JOIN, /PART, and /PRIVMSG, and features both public and private channels, user management, and real-time communication. The server includes authentication and permission management systems.

- **[FdF](https://github.com/bedarenn/FdF_matrix)**: The FdF_matrix project visualizes a map in an isometric 3D view, where data points are represented as a grid, and matrix rotations are used for transformations. The calculations rely on matrix rotations to achieve the isometric projection, providing an interactive 3D visualization. The project is implemented in C and the focus is on transforming and displaying data through graphical representation.
